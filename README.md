# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using an imbalanced dataset from Kaggle. Implemented in Python using Google Colab.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Contains 284,807 transactions with 492 fraudulent cases (highly imbalanced)

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used
- Undersampling to balance the dataset
- Logistic Regression for initial classification
- Evaluation using accuracy (improve with Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## ðŸ“Š Planned Improvements
- Use of advanced classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost
- Better evaluation metrics: ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
- Data visualization (class distribution, feature correlation)

## ðŸ’» Tools
- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
3. Run each cell in sequence

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Baseline model accuracy: ~94%
- Plan to improve fraud recall using ensemble methods
